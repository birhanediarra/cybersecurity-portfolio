# Birhane's Cybersecurity Portfolio
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. Here you will find a collection of hands‑on labs, investigations, and technical projects that demonstrate my skills in threat detection, system hardening, log analysis, and security operations. I built this portfolio to show how I approach problems, document processes, and think like an analyst as I continue to grow my cybersecurity skills.

## Current Labs:

### Wazuh SIEM Lab

A full deployment of a Wazuh SIEM environment using:

- Ubuntu Wazuh Manager
- Windows endpoint agent
- Authentication failure simulations
- Event Viewer correlation
- Alert analysis and documentation

This lab demonstrates the full pipeline from endpoint event → SIEM ingestion → alert interpretation.

### Additional Labs (Coming Soon)

## Portfolio Goals:
- Show practical, hands‑on security skills
- Demonstrate my ability to investigate and document security events
- Build a foundation for SOC, detection engineering, or security analyst roles beyond my CompTIA Security+ certification.
- Continue learning and improving through structured lab work
